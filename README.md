## Autonomous Vehicle Engineering Portfolio 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### A little bit about me
I'm a trilingual (English, Japanese, Malay) engineer whose life passion lies in helping cars self-navigate themselves with safety as their highest priority.

This repository is a portfolio of the projects I created for exploration of autonomous vehicle engineering. 
I hope you enjoy reading this as I enjoyed creating it!
