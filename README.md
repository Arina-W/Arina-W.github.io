## Hello. I'm Arina Wahab.
### I am an engaging team-player and detail-oriented trilingual (English, Japanese, Malay) engineer whose life passion lies in helping cars self-navigate themselves with safety as their highest priority. Latest project involved building a traffic lights classification pipeline that and lane boundaries detection pipeline on the road using Computer Vision in Python and C++. 

This repository is a portfolio of my projects which I created for exploration of machine learning engineering. 
Each category presents for separate projects.
