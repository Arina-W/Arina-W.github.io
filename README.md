## Hello. I'm Arina Wahab.
### I'm an engineer from Japan and my current life passion lies in helping cars self-navigate themselves with safety as their highest priority.

This repository is a portfolio of my projects which I created for exploration of machine learning engineering. 
Each category presents for separate projects.

### Table of contents

- Computer Vision
  - [Finding Lane Lines on the Road](https://github.com/Arina-W/Finding-Lane-Lines)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Arina-W/arina-w.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Arina-W/arina-w.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
