## Hello. I'm Arina Wahab.
### I'm an engineer from Japan and my current life passion lies in helping cars self-navigate themselves with safety as their highest priority.

This repository is a portfolio of my projects which I created for exploration of machine learning engineering. 
Each category presents for separate projects.
